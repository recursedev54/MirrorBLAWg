You are free to use this code commercially provided you have a "VIP" version of the MirrorDawGame, which is currently not possible. so no commercial use yet. More details about this to come.
You need vs code to run these .py scripts. this daw engine is used by building layers of indivual .py files in fullscreen tkinter windows. this is the basis for the framework.
# MirrorDAWg

Welcome to **MirrorDAWg**! This project is a revolutionary Digital Audio Workstation game that combines audio engineering, interactive gaming, and a rich user experience through a sophisticated and layered system.
## Overview

MirrorDAWg is designed to provide a unique experience for both audio professionals and gaming enthusiasts. It features a structured approach to digital audio processing and interactive elements that make it engaging and fun.

## Key Features

1. **Simulated Web and Server Environments**: MirrorDAWg includes a mock server using Tkinter that can function as a real server, allowing you to host it on free hosting platforms.
2. **Block Game Potential**: The project includes components for creating block-based games, enhancing the interactive gaming experience.

Welcome to **MirrorDAWg**! This project is a revolutionary Digital Audio Workstation ..;;[[//'']]game engine daw engine game..;;[[//'']] that combines audio engineering, interactive gaming, and a rich user experience through a sophisticated and layered system.

## Overview

MirrorDAWg is designed to provide a unique experience for both audio professionals and gaming enthusiasts. It features a structured approach to digital audio processing and interactive elements that make it engaging and fun.

## Project Structure

MirrorDAWg is organized into several key directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **badserver/**: Contains server-related scripts for managing network connections.
  - `badserver.py`
  
- **bash..;;[['']]/**: A unique folder structure containing console utilities, logging mechanisms, and password management scripts.
  - `console/console.py`
  - `loghead/loghead.py`
  - `password/password.py`
  
- **dawgserver/**: Handles the main server functionality for the DAW game.
  - `dawgserver.py`
  
- **doublelane~~/**: Manages additional functionalities and extensions.
  - `doublelane.py`
  
- **doublemain!/**: The main entry point for executing key operations.
  - `doublemain.py`
  
- **fake ide/**: A mock Integrated Development Environment to support the development process.
  - `fake ide.py`
  
- **hex_space/**: Manages the visual representation of hex colors in the UI.
  - `hex space.py`
  
- **icosik~space/**: Manages complex spatial arrangements within the UI.
  - `icosik space.py`
  
- **LOADIDE/**: Handles loading and initializing the IDE environment.
  - `LoadIde.py`
  
- **main#ly/**: Contains the primary script for running the application.
  - `main.py`
  
- **mirror_system/**: The heart of Mirror, containing the essential logic and mechanisms.
  - `mirror_system/mirror_system.py`
  
- **open_unknown/**: Manages operations for opening and interacting with unknown file types.
  - `open_unknown.py`
  
- **untitled_ide.py/**: Another script supporting the mock IDE functionality.
  - `fake ide.py`

## Mirror System Levels

Mirror is built on a multi-level system to provide a rich and layered experience:

- **ReflectEngine**: Handles basic reflections and echoes.
- **EchoEngine**: Manages more complex echo effects and spatial audio.
- **PrismEngine**: Breaks down audio into its constituent parts for detailed manipulation.
- **ReflexEngine**: Provides responsive audio feedback and adjustments.
- **ReverbEngine**: Adds reverberation effects to enhance the audio depth.

### Blood Level

The Blood Level is a lower level of the Mirror system, characterized by four channels with constants of 1234, dynamically changing in a fullscreen Tkinter window. This level adds an additional layer of interaction and complexity to the user experience.

## New Features

MirrorDAWg is continuously evolving with new features to enhance functionality and user engagement:

- **fakeDAW.py**: A 4-track recorder simulating four channels of six values, represented as hex codes.
- **recording.py**: Creates a new Tkinter window for recording sessions.
- **bash_doublemain.py**: Loads all files into one class and executes them from a known directory path, ensuring local execution.
- **loghead.py**: Similar to `recording.py`, this script simulates an ASCII animation of a flowing waterfall/console feed.
- **runtree.py**: Runs all files in its folder, simulating a portable installation for ease of use.

## Hosting the Server

MirrorDAWg includes a feature to create a mock server using Tkinter, which can function as a real server for hosting purposes. This allows you to host the server on a free hosting platform.

### Getting Started
