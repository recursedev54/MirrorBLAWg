MirrorBlawg Allows for recursed content. probably do not run the sunbird function. If you do, turn off your pc before it recursively destroys your memory and nukes your computer. #im not responsible, use at own risk. 
youll know when its recursing when you see over 28 popups looping very quicking bringing up infinite tkinker windows. this is probably not deathly if you just turn your computer off. i did it twice. #discretion advised
